# Credibility-Assessement---Experience-Mining

The objective of this project is to formulate a definition for credibility in general and most importantly how to define credibility from the students’ user group. The project also discusses the various factors identified by students to express whether the information is credible or not. Out of these, the project mainly concentrates on the factor “experience” to gauge the credibility.
